## 🧠 About Me  
I’m a graduate student in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University (GPA: 3.7/4.0), driven by the goal of turning raw data into meaningful action. With a background in Electronics & Telecom Engineering and industry experience across education, consulting, and manufacturing, I enjoy building scalable data pipelines, predictive models, and interactive dashboards.

From forecasting energy usage across 5,000+ homes to predicting NYPD crime hotspots using weather and incident data, I love working on projects that connect analytics with real-world outcomes.
